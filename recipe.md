Add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.

Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 25 - 30 minutes on the same shelf, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let it rest for 10 minutes in the pan then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool.

Remove the second cake from its pan. Place flat side down on top of the first layer. Use remaining frosting to cover top and sides of the cake, if desired.
